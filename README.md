# Applied Challenge 1 - Carter Brehm


## Scope Statement
The application will allow a user to learn about the restaurant before visiting, and submit feedback about their experience after their visit. 

The user will be able to view the menu of the restaurant sorted by category (including specials), view the hours and location of the restaurant (including special holiday hours), and make a reservation using OpenTable embedded on the site. Then, when the user has eaten at the restaurant, they can take a survey on which they can provide feedback about the food, service, and general experience.

## Usability Test

### Test Plan
- Is the app fast enough to load for a typical user?
- Are all of the elements in the DOM visible on all screen types?
- Do all available links work?
- Does the survey successfully record the response of the user?
- Is the menu page accurate to the on-site menu?
- Is all text readable on all background colors?

### User Testing

When I allowed the users access to the website without a goal, the first thing most of them gravitated to was the menu. Some mentioned that they needed pictures to properly evaluate the meals. However, since no pictures are provided as part of the assignment, I was unable to include these. They typically explored the entire menu page before moving on, but they skipped through all of the pages very quickly because there wasn't anything to draw their attention. Most read the entire hours page. They went through the rest of the pages going down on the home page, with no complaints.

When I asked the user to find the hours on Monday or the price of a Bistro burger, they had no problems. Everything was labelled well enough to infer where certain elements are.

There were also minor spelling mistakes and formatting glitches that were fixed during testing.
